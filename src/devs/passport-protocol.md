# Passport Protocol

When we talk about the "Passport Protocol", we are talking about the infrastructure which enables project owners and developers to gate their project, and for web3 citizens to create their own Passport to build their decentralized identity and access Passport-gated projects.

There will be three ways for projects to integrate with the Protocol and gate their project:

- The Gitcoin Scorer API (Preferred method)
- The Passport SDK (Will be deprecated soon)
- On-chain scores (coming soon)

Web3 citizens interface with the Passport Protocol through the Passport holder dApp at [passport.gitcoin.co](passport.gitcoin.co).
