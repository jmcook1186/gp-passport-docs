# Writer

Writer is the library in the Passport SDK that creates, reads, and updates a Gitcoin Passport. Writer allows you to create a front-end instance of Passport that is tailored to your community’s branding and onboarding or voting specifications. 

Writer essentially allows you to create a new data stream to store someone’s identity information in Ceramic without having to interact with Ceramic Network directly.

With Writer, you can issue your own verifiable credentials as well as retrieve someone’s DID from the Ceramic Network. This complements other libraries in the Passport SDK, such as Reader and Scorer, which focus specifically on assessing stamps.
