# Reader

Reader is a library in the Passport SDK which allows an integrated dApp to read any Passport stream on Ceramic. A Passport stream contains all the identity data for a single user in a way that can be accessed across chains. Reader is how your dApp or community can view data on the verifiable credentials stored in a userâ€™s Passport stamps without making personally identifiable information visible or accessible: it accesses the identity information stored on the Ceramic network and allows you to use it in your verification process.
