# Passport-Gating

This is a shorthand for noting that a project has integrated the [Passport Protocol](devs/passport-protocol.md) (e.g. Gitcoin Scorer API) for the purpose of screening accounts to keep out bots, bad actors, or simply real people who don't meet a certain threshold of trustworthiness.

**Usage:**

- "I like how this project gated its community with Gitcoin Passport. I'm going to ask the project owner for their gating algorithm, so I can use it for inspiration."
- "Some examples of Passport-gated dApps include: Snapshot, Bankless Academy, and Gitcoin Grants."
- "Because this community is gated with Gitcoin Passport, it is able to ask for pieces of proof of not just identity via services like BrightID, but also reputation via services like POAP."

See the [Quick Start Guide](devs/quick-start.md) to learn how to gate your project.
