## Deduplication of passport stamps

Gitcoin Passport stamp deduplication is a crucial feature that prevents Gitcoin Passport holders from setting up multiple Gitcoin Passports and using the same credentials, such as Twitter or Github accounts, to verify their stamps and identity.

In this context, multiple Gitcoin Passport holders refer to individuals who possess more than one Gitcoin Passport, which may have identical stamps. This can create inconsistencies in the verification process, making it challenging for developers to ensure that each user has a unique and consistent digital identity.

Our platform's Gitcoin Passport stamp deduplication feature automatically identifies and eliminates duplicate Gitcoin Passport stamps, preventing users from using the same credentials to verify their stamps and identity across multiple Gitcoin Passports. This ensures that each user in an application has a unique and consistent digital identity, simplifying the verification process and improving the overall user experience.

When multiple Passport holders hold identical stamps, it's crucial that the Gitcoin Scorer API has a deduplication strategy in place to ensure that the same verifiable credential (VC) isn't counted multiple times in a given scoring instance. The API aims to offer several deduplication strategies, with the default approach being the last in, first out (LIFO) method. This strategy ensures that, in a given scoring instance, if a Passport holder submits a VC that has already been submitted by another Passport holder, the duplicate VC is ignored and not counted towards the score.

Let’s say you run an application that utilizes the Gitcoin Passport API to verify the unique humanity of your users. Two distinct Passports, “Passport A” and “Passport B,” submit the same stamp based on the same Twitter account to your app. In this scenario, the Last-in-First-out deduplication method would only count the stamp instance that was more previously submitted.

For example, if Passport A submitted the Twitter stamp first, followed by Passport B, your app would only count the instance of the Twitter stamp submitted by Passport A. The instance submitted by Passport B would not be counted, as it was submitted more recently than the instance submitted by Passport A. The same rule applies to any subsequent instances of the stamp, regardless of the Passport.

This method ensures that each Passport’s score accurately reflects the unique identity of its holder by only considering the more previously submitted instance of each stamp. By doing so, duplicate stamps in multiple Passports will not skew the verification process or give Passport holders an unfair advantage.

It's worth noting that the deduplication process is handled on an independent basis in each scoring instance. This means that if one user uses Passport holder A with one Twitter account in an application that uses scoring instance X, and another user uses the same Twitter account in a distinct Passport in an independent scoring instance Y, both users will get scored for the Twitter account. As long as the scoring instances are independent, there is no concern for double counting or interference between instances.

The LIFO deduplication strategy has several benefits for Passport holders and developers. It ensures that each Passport holder (aka wallet address) is assessed based on their unique set of stamps, and that no one receives an unfair advantage due to having the same stamp as another Passport holder within a given scoring instance. This means that for applications utilizing our API, there will be no double-counting of stamps within the app, ensuring a fair and accurate assessment of each user’s unique identity. In addition, the scores assigned to Passports are permanent and will not change once they are issued. This means that there is no need to recalculate Passport scores or synchronize them again in case of duplicate stamp submissions. Once a score is assigned to a Passport, it remains fixed and can be relied upon for future verifications, even if a duplicate stamp is submitted by a new Passport.. This makes the scoring process more efficient and streamlined, which is particularly important for large and complex applications that score a high volume of verifiable credentials.
