# Connecting to apps

Connecting your Passport to an app couldn't be easier. If an application uses Gitcoin passport it will display a "connect" button. Clicking it will open a prompt to connect using an Ethereum wallet. Choose your wallet, sign the message that appears, and the app takes care of everything else. Behind the scenes, the app will send a request to the Gitcoin passport API to retrieve your Passport score. As a user, you will simply see the content available to you based on your passport score.
