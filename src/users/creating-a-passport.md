# How to create a Gitcoin Passport

Visit the [Gitcoin Passport app](passport.gitcoin.co)

When you arrive at the passport app you'll be prompted to sign in with your Ethereum wallet.

With your wallet connected, you'll be prompted to sign a message allowing the app to sign in with your Ethereum account and access your data on Ceramic.

If this is your first time using the Passport app, you will get a new Passport created for you.
If you are a returning user your Passport information should be retrieved and you can see your previously saved Stamps.
If it has been longer than 90 days since you last logged in, you may be presented with a fresh Passport. This is because stamps expire/decay after 90 days and you are required to refresh them to confirm the details are still accurate.
